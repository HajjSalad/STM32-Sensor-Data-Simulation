## Sensor Data Simulation

This project simulates analog sensor readings on STM32 using the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL). The simulated data is transmitted to an ESP32 for integration into [IoT Control and Monitor System](https://github.com/HajjSalad/ESP32-IoT-Control-and-Monitor-System).

#### Tools
**PWM:** Generate analog-like signals for sensor simulation.<br>
**ADC:** Sample the PWM signals to convert them into digital sensor data.<br>
**UART:** Transmit the simulated sensor data from STM32 to ESP32.<br>
