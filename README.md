## Sensor Data Simulation

This project simulates analog sensor readings on STM32 using the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), leveraging Timers, PWM, and ADC for seamless integration into an IoT system. Sensor data is transmitted to an ESP32 via UART with a handshake mechanism to ensure reliable communication, enabling real-time control, monitoring, and cloud connectivity.
